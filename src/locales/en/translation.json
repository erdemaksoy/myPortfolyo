Function calls and local variables are stored here. It provides fast access but has a limited size, which is known at compile time.</p><p><b>Heap:</b> Used for dynamic memory allocation. It is managed via <i>new</i> and <i>delete</i> operators. Ideal for large data structures and objects whose size is not known at compile time, but it is slower and more complex to manage.</p><h4>Smart Pointers</h4><p>In modern C++, smart pointers that apply the <i>RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</i> principle are used to prevent memory leaks:</p><ul><li><b>unique_ptr:</b> A single ownership model. It automatically releases memory when the object it points to goes out of scope. It cannot be copied, only moved.</li><li><b>shared_ptr:</b> A shared ownership model. It keeps a reference counter. The counter increments as you copy the pointer and decrements when a copy is destroyed. Memory is released when the counter reaches zero. Be cautious of circular dependency risks.</li><li><b>weak_ptr:</b> Used in conjunction with <i>shared_ptr</i> but does not share ownership. It's ideal for breaking circular references.</li></ul>"

Operations like API requests, DOM manipulations, or subscriptions are managed here.</li></ul><h4>Context API for Global State</h4><p>Instead of passing state deep down the component tree (prop drilling), the Context API is used to create a globally accessible state. A <i>Provider</i> component provides the state, and any component in the tree can access this state using the <i>useContext</i> hook. It offers a simple alternative to external libraries like Redux.</p>"

But what are the core concepts behind this power?</p><h4>Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)</h4><p>IoC is the principle where an object delegates the responsibility of creating its dependencies to an external force (the Spring IoC Container). Dependency Injection is a way to implement this principle. Spring automatically 'injects' the objects a class needs using the <i>@Autowired</i> annotation. This promotes loose coupling between classes and increases testability.</p><h4>Auto-Configuration</h4><p>This is one of Spring Boot's most magical features. It automatically configures the beans and settings your application might need by looking at the JAR files in your project's classpath. For example, if you add Spring Data JPA to your project, it will prepare all the necessary configuration for a database connection for you.</p><h4>Layered Architecture and Annotations</h4><p>Spring Boot supports a layered architecture and provides a set of useful annotations to manage these layers:</p><ul><li><b>@RestController:</b> Indicates that a class hosts RESTful API endpoints.</li><li><b>@Service:</b> Represents the business logic layer.</li><li><b>@Repository:</b> Marks the data access layer (DAO).</li><li><b>@Component:</b> A generic component that should be managed by Spring.</li></ul>"

Let's look at some of the key features that make it so powerful.</p><h4>High Performance</h4><p>Modern .NET is one of the fastest backend frameworks available. Thanks to the Kestrel web server, an optimized JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, and memory management improvements, it provides maximum efficiency with minimal resources. This makes it ideal for high-traffic APIs and microservices.</p><h4>Middleware Pipeline</h4><p>In ASP.NET Core, every incoming HTTP request passes through a middleware pipeline. Each middleware component can inspect, modify, or pass the request to the next component. This structure makes it easy to manage cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching in a modular way.</p><h4>Built-in Dependency Injection (DI)</h4><p>Like Spring Boot, .NET comes with a built-in Dependency Injection container. By registering your services in the <i>Program.cs</i> (or <i>Startup.cs</i>) file, you can have them automatically injected into any constructor or method that needs them. This encourages writing flexible and testable code.</p><h4>Entity Framework Core (EF Core)</h4><p>EF Core is a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. It allows you to write SQL queries directly in C# code using LINQ (Language-Integrated Query). By mapping database tables to C# classes, it abstracts and simplifies database operations.</p>"
